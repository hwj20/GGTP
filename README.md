# Graphormer-Guided Task Planning (GGTP)

ðŸš€ **Graphormer-Guided Task Planning** is an AI-driven task planning framework that combines LLM-based decision-making with Graphormer-enhanced risk assessment.

Robots may be great at moving around, but can they *think* before they act?  
We introduce Graphormer-based task planning with LLM-driven safety perception,  
helping domestic robots navigate complex environments without, wellâ€¦ accidentally microwaving the cat.
We aim to enhance task planning in domestic robots by utilzing Graphormer-based and LLM-driven safety perception to dynamically adapt to complex environments.



## ðŸ›  Installation
Set 'OPENAI_API_KEY' as an environment variable with your own key.

Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hwj20/GGTP.git
cd GGTP
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate GGTP
python main.py
```
This will run a sample task planning on ai2-thor floor1.
