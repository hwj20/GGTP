Robots may be great at moving around, but can they *think* before they act?  
We introduce Graphormer-based task planning with LLM-driven safety perception,  
helping domestic robots navigate complex environments without, wellâ€¦ accidentally microwaving the cat.
We aim to enhance task planning in domestic robots by utilzing Graphormer-based and LLM-driven safety perception to dynamically adapt to complex environments.



## ðŸ›  Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hwj20/GGTP.git
cd GGTP
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate GGTP
python main.py
```
This will run a sample task planning on ai2-thor floor1.
